## Summary: 
# This solution is a continuation of question 15.2 so please jump down to step 1 where 
# you will see the code for the new constraints. You'll see I run two optimizations, the first 
# simply solves given these newly added constraints and produces an unporportional recommendation of 
# broccoli while gaming the optimization and only selecting a trivial portion of the
# protein constraints. 


# To counter this, I include a fourth constraint that no food amount should be greater than 5.
# You will see my results commented at the very bottom but what instantly stands out is the cost
# jumps from ~$5 to over $10 and the amount of foods selected jumps to 9 sources

# One final note, I was fairly new to the pulp package so I relied heavily on both the office hours
# in addition to a few tutorials. One in particular stood out which walked through a similar
# optimization process which is found in a towardsdatascience write up. You can find that link below:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-programming-and-discrete-optimization-with-python-using-pulp-449f3c5f6e99

## Newly Added Constraints
# 1.  If a food is selected, then a minimum of 1/10 serving must be chosen. (Hint: now you will
# need two variables for each food i: whether it is chosen, and how much is part of the diet.
#Youâ€™ll also need to write a constraint to link them.)
# 2.  Many people dislike celery and frozen broccoli. So at most one, but not both, can be
#selected.
#3.  To get day-to-day variety in protein, at least 3 kinds of meat/poultry/fish/eggs must be
#selected.

##### library setup #####

##### data arrangement and labeling #####
data = pd.read_excel('/Users/vincentcholewa/Documents/GAT/ISYE/isye_wd/diet.xls', header = 0)
#print(diet_data.head(5))

#print(len_diet)

# Looking at the tail it appears rows 65 & 66 contain the min and max daily intake. Let's create a variable to
# store both those constraints 
min_cal = data[65:66].values.tolist()

# slice only food composition data and create list
diet_data = data[0:64]
# create lists of list (per office hour recommendations)

# create a list comprehension to store food labels
food_names = [x[0] for x in diet_data]

# create dictionaries to store both cost & calories of food
food_cost = dict([(x[0], float(x[1])) for x in diet_data]) 
#food_cals = dict([[x[0], float(x[3])) for x in diet_data])

# setup nutrient names and create a list to hold each nutrient per food

#print(nutrient_names)

for i in range(0,11): 
    nutrients.append(dict([(x[0], float(x[i+3])) for x in diet_data])) 



##### defining optimization and solving for minimization #####

# define variables(the optimal amount of recommended food. we use a constraint, 0, to indicate 
# that we cannot have negative values)

food_amount = LpVariable.dicts("Food Amounts", food_names,lowBound=0,cat='Continuous')
food_chosen = LpVariable.dicts("Chosen Food",food_names,0,1,cat='Integer')


# add the objective function which you can see is the sum product of the cost x amount of food 
problem += lpSum([food_cost[x] * food_amount[x] for x in food_names])


# add constraints for min & max values for each food with the range being >= 1500 and <+ 2500 through list comprehension
for i in range(0, 11):
	problem += lpSum([nutrients[i][j] * food_amount[j] for j in food_names]) >= min_cal[0][i+3], 'minimum calories' + nutrient_names[i]
	problem += lpSum([nutrients[i][j] * food_amount[j] for j in food_names]) >= max_cal[0][i+3], 'maximum calories' + nutrient_names[i]

### Additional Constraints
## part 2: if a food is selected, it must comprise at least 10% of the total
# food intake. The following code looks to ensure that if the food product is used
# it will represent at least 10% of the meal. 
for f in food_names:
    problem += food_amount[f]>= food_chosen[f]*0.1
    problem += food_amount[f]<= food_chosen[f]*1e5

 

## Part 2: limit the meal to include only frozen brocolli or celery but not both
problem += food_chosen['Frozen Broccoli'] + food_chosen['Celery, Raw'] <= 1 

## Part 3: at least 3x protein source must be included. I'll use a similar method as the 
# constraint built in part 2 but I am certain there is a more efficient way of doing this with
# pandas using iloc/loc.

problem += food_chosen['Tofu'] + food_chosen['Roasted Chicken'] + food_chosen['Poached Eggs'] \
	+food_chosen['Scrambled Eggs'] + food_chosen['Bologna,Turkey'] \

# Admittely this is including food sources that traditonally would not be considered a true protein
# source such as the clamchowders, bean bacon soupssss, etc. 	


# Constraint 4 (Optionally Created, remove comment to run code

# constraint above to run the second optimization to ensure broccoli doesn't
